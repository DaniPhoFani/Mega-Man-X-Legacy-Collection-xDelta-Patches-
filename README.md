# Mega-Man-X-Legacy-Collection-xDelta-Patches-
The intended purpose of these patches is to apply them to the extracted roms of Mega Man X, Mega Man X2, and Mega Man X3 from the Mega Man X Legacy Collection on Steam. Open Delta patcher and under "Original File", select either "megamanx.sfc", "megamanx2.sfc", "megamanx3sfc", "rockman.sfc", "rockman2.sfc", or "rockman3.sfc" and then select the corresponding xdelta patch. I've included separate patches to patch Mega/Rock Man X1 to it's original SNES/SFC release as well as their Rev 1 releases, as some romhacks use the original and some use Rev 1. Enjoy!
